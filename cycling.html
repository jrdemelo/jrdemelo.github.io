			Six years ago when I moved to Boston I was faced with a choice: I could spend 2 hours a day on the T getting to and from work or I could buy a cheap bike off Amazon and test my luck commuting the 3 miles to and from work. Needless to say choosing the bike was one of has been one of the best decisions of my life.<br /><br />
			Over the past six years I've run through a half dozen bikes, racked up thousands of miles, started racing cyclocross, and have reached the point where I think competing in the Race Across America (RAAM) would actually be pretty fun. For the time being I'm focused on getting my USAC coaching license, chasing an eventual Cat 3 CX upgrade, and pretending I have any clue how to mountain bike.<br /><br />
